# Goose Configuration for tanzu-agent
# This file configures default Goose behavior when running in Cloud Foundry
#
# See: https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/configuration-files/
#
# Note: Provider/model configuration is now managed via providers-config.yml
# and the multi-provider UI. GenAI service binding (if present) takes precedence.

# Extensions to enable by default
extensions:
  developer:
    enabled: true

# Session defaults
session:
  # Maximum turns before requiring user input (prevents runaway sessions)
  max_turns: 100

# Skills - reusable instruction sets for Goose
# Skills are loaded from a centralized Git repository for easier management
# Update the repository URL below to point to your skills marketplace repository
